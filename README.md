# Purpose
This repository contains the reusable infrastructure modules that make up the [Live Infrastrcture](https://github.com/kasra-arnavaz/Infra-live). Having defined modules removes duplication when creating various environments such as dev, stage, prod and would keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
